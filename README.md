My second project using Javascript, the main purpose of this project is to consolidate my skills in HTML, CSS and Vanilla Javascript. In this project I will be using more advanced CSS features, like grid, flexbox and animations. All the logic will be implemented using vanilla javascript aiming to consolidate my knowledge in functions and DOM manipulation.
